## Description

Guest users can be set up for those users not in the organization to still be granted access to resources. It is important to maintain visibility for what guest users are established in the tenant.

Ensure Guest Users are reviewed no less frequently than biweekly.

**Note:** With the E5 license an access review can be configured to review guest accounts automatically on a reoccurring basis. This is the preferred method if the licensing is available.

## Remediation

To review guest users in the UI:

1. Navigate to `Microsoft 365 admin center` https://admin.microsoft.com/.
2. Click to expand `Users` and select `Guest Users.`
3. Review the list of users.

To verify Microsoft 365 audit log search is enabled using Microsoft Graph PowerShell:

1. Connect using `Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "User.Read.All"`
2. Run the following PowerShell command:

```bash
Get-MgUser -All -Property UserType,UserPrincipalName | Where {$_.UserType -ne "Member"} | Format-Table UserPrincipalName, UserType
```

3. Review the list of users. If nothing is returned then there are no guest users.
