## Description

Microsoft Entra ID Protection user risk policies detect the probability that a user account has been compromised.

**Note:** While Identity Protection also provides two risk policies with limited conditions, Microsoft highly recommends setting up risk-based policies in Conditional Access as opposed to the "legacy method" for the following benefits:

  - Enhanced diagnostic data
  - Report-only mode integration
  - Graph API support
  - Use more Conditional Access attributes like sign-in frequency in the policy

With the user risk policy turned on, Azure AD detects the probability that a user account has been compromised. Administrators can configure a user risk conditional access policy to automatically respond to a specific user risk level.

## Remediation

To configure a User risk policy, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the `Microsoft Entra admin center` https://entra.microsoft.com.
2. Click expand `Protection` > `Conditional Access` select `Policies.`
3. Create a new policy by selecting `New policy.`
4. Set the following conditions within the policy:
    - Under `Users or workload identities` choose `All users.`
    - Under `Cloud apps or actions` choose `All cloud apps.`
    - Under `Conditions` choose `User risk` then `Yes` and select the user risk level `High`.
    - Under `Access Controls` select `Grant` then in the right pane click `Grant access` then select  `Require multifactor authentication` and `Require password change.`
    - Under `Session` ensure `Sign-in frequency` is set to `Every time.`
    - Click `Select.`
5. Under `Enable policy` set it to `Report Only` until the organization is ready to enable it.
6. Click `Create.`
