## Description

App registration allows users to register custom-developed applications for use within the directory.

Third-party integrated applications connection to services should be disabled unless there is a very clear value and robust security controls are in place. While there are legitimate uses, attackers can grant access from breached accounts to third party applications to exfiltrate data from your tenancy without having to maintain the breached account.
