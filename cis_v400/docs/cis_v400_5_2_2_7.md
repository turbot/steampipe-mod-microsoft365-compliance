## Description

Microsoft Entra ID Protection sign-in risk detects risks in real-time and offline. A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might not have been performed by the legitimate owner of a user account.

**Note:** While Identity Protection also provides two risk policies with limited conditions, Microsoft highly recommends setting up risk-based policies in Conditional Access as opposed to the "legacy method" for the following benefits:

- Enhanced diagnostic data
- Report-only mode integration
- Graph API support
- Use more Conditional Access attributes like sign-in frequency in the policy.

Turning on the sign-in risk policy ensures that suspicious sign-ins are challenged for multi-factor authentication.

## Remediation

**To configure a Sign-In risk policy, use the following steps:**

1. Navigate to the `Microsoft Entra admin center` [https://entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com).
2. Click expand `Protection` > `Conditional Access` select `Policies`.
3. Create a new policy by selecting `New policy`.
4. Set the following conditions within the policy.
 - Under `Users or workload identities` choose `All users`.
 - Under `Cloud apps or actions` choose `All cloud apps`.
 - Under `Conditions` choose `Sign-in risk` then `Yes` and check the risk level boxes `High` and `Medium`.
 - Under `Access Controls` select `Grant` then in the right pane click `Grant access` then select `Require multifactor authentication`.
 - Under `Session` select `Sign-in Frequency` and set to `Every time`.
 - Click `Select`.
5. Under `Enable policy` set it to `Report Only` until the organization is ready to enable it.
6. Click `Create`.
