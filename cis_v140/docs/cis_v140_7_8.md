## Description

You should require your users to use encryption on their mobile devices.

Unencrypted devices can be stolen and their data extracted by an attacker very easily.

## Remediation

To set mobile device management profiles, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Under `Admin Centers` select `Endpoint Management`.
2. Select `Devices` and then under `Policy` select `Configuration profiles`.
3. Select `Create profile`.
4. Set a `Name` for the policy, choose `Android` as the `Platform` and select `Device restrictions`.
5. In the `Password` section, ensure that `Encryption` is set to `Require`.

**Default Value:** Device encryption is not required by the O365 platform by default, although some mobile platforms are encrypted by default.
