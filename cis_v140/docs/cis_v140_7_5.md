## Description

Require mobile devices to wipe on multiple sign-in failures

Devices without this protection are vulnerable to being accessed physically by attackers who can then steal account credentials, data, or install malware on the device.

## Remediation

To set mobile device management profiles, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Under `Admin Centers` select `Endpoint Management`.
2. Select `Devices` and then under `Policy` select `Configuration profiles`.
3. Select `Create profile`.
4. Set a `Name` for the policy, choose the appropriate `Platform` and select `Device restrictions`.
5. In the `Password` section, ensure that `Number of sign-in failures before wiping device` is set to `10`.

**Default Value:** The default is to not wipe the device on multiple failed attempts.
