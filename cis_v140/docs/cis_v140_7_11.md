## Description

You should configure your mobile device management policies to require the PC to have anti-virus and have a firewall enabled.

If you do not require this, users will be able to connect from devices that are vulnerable to basic internet attacks, leading to potential breaches of accounts and data.

## Remediation

To set mobile device management policies, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Under `Admin Centers` select `Endpoint Management`.
2. Select `Devices` and then under `Policy` select `Compliance policies`.
3. Select `Create Policy`.
4. Set a `Name` for the policy, choose the appropriate PC `Platform`.
5. Select `System Security` under `Settings`.
6. Under `Device Security` set the values for `Firewall`, `Antivirus`, and `Antispyware` all to `Require`.
