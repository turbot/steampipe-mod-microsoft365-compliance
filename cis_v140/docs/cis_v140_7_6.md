## Description

You should require your users to use a minimum password length of at least six characters to unlock their mobile devices.

Devices without this protection are vulnerable to being accessed physically by attackers who can then steal account credentials, data, or install malware on the device.

## Remediation

To set mobile device management profiles, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Under `Admin Centers` select `Endpoint Management`.
2. Select `Devices` and then under `Policy` select `Configuration profiles`.
3. Select `Create profile`.
4. Set a `Name` for the policy, choose the appropriate `Platform` and select `Device restrictions`.
5. In the `Password` section, ensure that `Minimum password length` is set to `6`.

**Default Value:** Minimum password lengths are not enforced by default.
