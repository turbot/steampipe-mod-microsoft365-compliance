## Description

You should prevent company data from OneDrive for Business from being synchronized to non-corporate managed devices.

## Remediation

### From Console

To block the sync client on unmanaged devices, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Navigate to Microsoft 365 administration portal (https://admin.microsoft.com), Click on `All Admin Centers` and then `Show All` then `SharePoint`.
2. Now click `Settings` followed by `OneDrive - Sync`.
3. Check the `Allow syncing only on computers joined to specific domains`.
4. Use the `Get-ADDomain` PowerShell command to obtain the GUID from each domain then add them to the box.
5. Click `Save`.

To block the sync client on unmanaged devices, you can also use SharePoint Online PowerShell:

1. Connect to SharePoint Online using Connect-SPOService.

2. Run the following PowerShell command and provide the DomainGuids from the Get-AADomain command:

```bash
Set-SPOTenantSyncClientRestriction -Enable -DomainGuids "786548DD-877B-4760-A749-6B1EFBC1190A; 877564FF-877B-4760-A749-6B1EFBC1190A"
```

**NOTE:** Utilize the -BlockMacSync:$true parameter if you are not using conditional access to ensure Macs cannot sync.

**Default Value:** This feature is not enabled by default.
