## Description

By default, users can consent to applications accessing your organization's data, although only for some permissions. For example, by default a user can consent to allow an app to access their own mailbox or the Teams conversations for a team the user owns, but cannot consent to allow an app unattended access to read and write to all SharePoint sites in your organization.

Do not allow users to grant consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf.

## Remediation

### From Console

To prohibit user consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Select `Admin Centers` and Azure `Active Directory`.
2. Select `Enterprise applications` from the Azure navigation pane.
3. Under `Security` select `Consent and permissions`.
4. Under `User consent for applications` select `Do not allow user consent`.
5. Click the `Save` option at the top of the window.

To prohibit user consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf, use the Microsoft Online PowerShell Module:

1. Connect to Microsoft Online service using `Connect-MSOLService`.
2. Run the following Microsoft Online PowerShell command:

```bash
Set-MsolCompanySettings -UsersPermissionToUserConsentToAppEnabled $False
```
