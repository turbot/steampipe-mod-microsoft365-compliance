## Description

By default, users can consent to applications accessing your organization's data, although only for some permissions. For example, by default a user can consent to allow an app to access their own mailbox or the Teams conversations for a team the user owns, but cannot consent to allow an app unattended access to read and write to all SharePoint sites in your organization.

Do not allow users to grant consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf.
