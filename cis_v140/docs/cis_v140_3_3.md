## Description

As of December 2021 the default for Teams external communication is set to 'People in my organization can communicate with Teams users whose accounts aren't managed by an organization.' This means that users can communicate with personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Hotmail, Outlook etc.), which presents data loss / phishing / social engineering risks.

**NOTE:** Skype for business is deprecated as of July 31, 2021 although these settings may still be valid for a period of time. See the the link in the reference for more information.

## Remediation

   - Note: If organizational policy allows select any allowed external domains.
