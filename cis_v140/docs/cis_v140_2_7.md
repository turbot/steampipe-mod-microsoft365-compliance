## Description

Without an admin consent workflow (Preview), a user in a tenant where user consent is disabled will be blocked when they try to access any app that requires permissions to access organizational data. The user sees a generic error message that says they're unauthorized to access the app and they should ask their admin for help.

## Remediation

### From Console

To enable the admin consent workflow (Preview), use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Select `Admin Centers` and `Azure Active Directory`.
2. Select `Enterprise applications` from the Azure Navigation pane.
3. Under `Manage` select `Users settings`.
4. Set `Users can request admin consent to apps they are unable to consent to` to `Yes` under `Admin consent requests`.
5. Under the `Reviewers` choose the Roles, Groups that you would like to review user generated app consent requests.
6. Select `Save` at the top of the window.

**Default Value:**

  1. Users can request admin consent to apps they are unable to consent to: No
  2. Selected users to review admin consent requests: None
  3. Selected users will receive email notifications for requests: Yes
  4. Selected users will receive request expiration reminders: Yes
  5. Consent request expires after (days): 30
