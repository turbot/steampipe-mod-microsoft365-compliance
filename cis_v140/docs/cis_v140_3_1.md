## Description

You should enable the Customer Lockbox feature. It requires Microsoft to get your approval for any datacenter operation that grants a Microsoft support engineer or other employee direct access to any of your data. For example, in some cases a Microsoft support engineer might need access to your Microsoft 365 content in order to help troubleshoot and fix an issue for you. Customer lockbox requests also have an expiration time, and content access is removed after the support engineer has fixed the issue.

## Remediation

To enable the Customer Lockbox feature, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Portal:

1. Browse to the `Microsoft 365 admin center`.
2. Expand `Settings` then select `Org settings`
3. Choose `Security & privacy` in the right pane.
4. Click `Customer Lockbox`.
5. Check the box `Require approval for all data access requests`.
6. Click `Save`.

To set the Customer Lockbox feature to enabled, use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module:

1. Run Exchange Online PowerShell Module.
