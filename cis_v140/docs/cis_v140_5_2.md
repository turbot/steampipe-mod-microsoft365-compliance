## Description

By turning on mailbox auditing, Microsoft 365 back office teams can track logons to a mailbox as well as what actions are taken while the user is logged on. After you turn on mailbox audit logging for a mailbox, you can search the audit log for mailbox activity. Additionally, when mailbox audit logging is turned on, some actions performed by administrators, delegates, and owners are logged by default.

## Remediation

### From Console

To enable mailbox auditing for all users, use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module:

1. Run Microsoft Exchange Online `PowerShell Module`.
2. Connect using `Connect-EXOPSSession`.
3. Run the following PowerShell commands:

```
$AuditAdmin = @("Copy", "Create", "FolderBind",
"HardDelete", "MessageBind", "Move", "MoveToDeletedItems", "SendAs",
"SendOnBehalf", "SoftDelete", "Update", "UpdateCalendarDelegation",
"UpdateFolderPermissions", "UpdateInboxRules")
$AuditDelegate =
@("Create", "FolderBind", "HardDelete", "Move", "MoveToDeletedItems", "SendAs
", "SendOnBehalf", "SoftDelete", "Update", "UpdateFolderPermissions", "Update
InboxRules")
$AdminOwner =
@("Create", "HardDelete", "MailboxLogin", "Move", "MoveToDeletedItems", "Soft
Delete", "Update", "UpdateCalendarDelegation",
"UpdateFolderPermissions", "UpdateInboxRules")
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited | Set-Mailbox -AuditEnabled $true -
AuditLogAgeLimit 180 -AuditAdmin $AuditAdmin -AuditDelegate $AuditDelegate -
AuditOwner $AuditOwner
```
