## Description

By default, users can install add-ins in their Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint applications, allowing data access within the application. Do not allow users to install add-ins in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.

Attackers commonly use vulnerable and custom-built add-ins to access data in user applications.

While allowing users to install add-ins by themselves does allow them to easily acquire useful add-ins that integrate with Microsoft applications, it can represent a risk if not used and monitored carefully.

Disable future user's ability to install add-ins in Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint helps reduce your threat-surface and mitigate this risk.

## Remediation

To prohibit users installing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint add-ins, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Select `Settings` from the navigation pane.
2. Select `Org Settings` from the navigation pane.
3. Under `Services` select `User owned apps and services`.
4. De-Select `Let users access the Office Store` and `Let users start trials on behalf of your organization`.
5. Click `Save`.

**Default Value:**

1. Let users access the Office Store is Checked
