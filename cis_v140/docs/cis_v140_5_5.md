## Description

The Microsoft 365 platforms allow a user to reset their password in the event they forget it. The self-service password reset activity report logs each time a user successfully resets their password this way. You should review the self-service password reset activity report at least weekly.

An attacker will commonly compromise an account, then change the password to something they control and can manage.

## Remediation

To review the report, perform the following steps using the Azure Portal:

1. Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Go to `Azure Active Directory`.
3. Click on `Usage & insights` under `Monitoring`.
4. Select `Authentication methods activity` and the `Usage` tab.
5. Review the list of users who have reset their passwords in the last seven days by clicking 'Self-service password resets and account unlocks by method'.
