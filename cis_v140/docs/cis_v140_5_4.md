## Description

You should review the Application Usage report at least weekly. This report includes a usage summary for all Software As A Service (SaaS) applications that are integrated with your directory.

Review the list of app registrations on a regular basis to look for risky apps that users have enabled that could cause data spillage or accidental elevation of privilege. Attackers can often get access to data illicitly through third-party SaaS applications.

## Remediation

To review the report, perform the following steps using the Azure Portal:

1. Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Click `Azure Active Directory`.
3. Select `Enterprise applications`.
4. Review the information.
