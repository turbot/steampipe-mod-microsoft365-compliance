## Description

Modern authentication in Microsoft 365 enables authentication features like multifactor authentication (MFA) using smart cards, certificate-based authentication (CBA), and third- party SAML identity providers. When you enable modern authentication in Skype for Business, the Skype for Business client uses modern authentication to log in to Skype for Business Online.

**Note:** Skype for business is deprecated as of July 31, 2021 although these settings may still be valid for a period of time. See the the link in the reference for more information.


## Remediation

1. Connect to Skype for Business Online using the following Powershell commands:

```
  Import-Module MicrosoftTeams Connect-MicrosoftTeams $sfbSession
