## Description

By default, users can install add-ins in their Microsoft Outlook Desktop client, allowing data access within the client application.

Do not allow users to install add-ins in Outlook.

## Remediation

### From Console

To prohibit users installing Outlook add-ins, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Select `Admin Centers` and `Exchange`.
2. Click on the `Classic Exchange admin center` at the bottom.
3. Select `permissions` from the Exchange navigation pane.
4. Select `user roles`.
5. De-Select `My Custom Apps My Marketplace Apps` and `My ReadWriteMailboxApps`.

To prohibit users installing Outlook add-ins, use the Microsoft Online PowerShell Module:

1. Connect to Microsoft Online service using `Connect-MSOLService`.
2. Run the following Microsoft Online PowerShell command:

```bash
$newPolicyName = "Role Assignment Policy - Prevent Add-ins"
$revisedRoles = "MyTeamMailboxes", "MyTextMessaging", "MyDistributionGroups", "MyMailSubscriptions", "MyBaseOptions", "MyVoiceMail", "MyProfileInformation", "MyContactInformation", "MyRetentionPolicies", "MyDistributionGroupMembership"
New-RoleAssignmentPolicy -Name $newPolicyName -Roles $revisedRoles
Set-RoleAssignmentPolicy -id $newPolicyName -IsDefault
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited | Set-Mailbox -RoleAssignmentPolicy $newPolicyName
```

**If you have other Role Assignment Policies modify the last line to filter out your custom policies.**
