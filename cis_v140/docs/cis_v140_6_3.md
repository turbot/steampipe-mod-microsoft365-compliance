## Description

You should restrict the length of time that anonymous access links are valid.

An attacker can compromise a user account for a short period of time, send anonymous sharing links to an external account, then take their time accessing the data. They can also compromise external accounts and steal the anonymous sharing links sent to those external entities well after the data has been shared. Restricting how long the links are valid can reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.

## Remediation

To set expiration for anonymous access links, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Select `Admin Centers` and `SharePoint`.
2. Expand `Polices` then click `Sharing`.
3. Under `Choose expiration and permissions options for Anyone links`. Check the `These links must expire within this many days`.
4. Set to the desired number of days, such as `30`.
5. Click `Save`.

To set expiration for anonymous access links, you can also use SharePoint Online PowerShell:

1. Connect to SharePoint Online using `Connect-SPOService`.
2. Run the following PowerShell command:

```bash
set-SPOTenant -RequireAnonymousLinksExpireInDays 30
```

**Default Value:**

1. Anonymous Sharing - On
2. Sharing Links Expiration - Off
