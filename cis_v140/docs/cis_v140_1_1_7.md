## Description

Ensure that password hash sync is enabled for resiliency and leaked credential detection.

Password hash synchronization is one of the sign-in methods used to accomplish hybrid identity. Azure AD Connect synchronizes a hash, of the hash, of a user's password from an on-premises Active Directory instance to a cloud-based Azure AD instance. Password hash synchronization helps by reducing the number of passwords your users need to maintain to just one. Enabling password hash synchronization also allows for leaked credential reporting. It can also be used as a backup authentication method when federation is used, if the federation provider fails.

## Remediation

To setup Password Hash Sync, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the server that hosts the Azure AD Connect tool.
2. Double-click the `Azure AD Connect` icon that was created on the desktop.
3. Click `Configure`.
4. On the `Additional tasks` page, select `Customize synchronization options` and click `Next`.
5. Enter the username and password for your global administrator.
6. On the `Connect your directories` screen, click `Next`.
7. On the `Domain and OU filtering` screen, click `Next`.
8. On the `Optional features` screen, check `Password hash synchronization` and click `Next`.
9. On the `Ready to configure` screen click `Configure`.
10. Once the configuration completes, click `Exit`.
