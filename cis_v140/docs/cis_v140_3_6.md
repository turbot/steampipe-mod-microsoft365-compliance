## Description

SharePoint gives users the ability to share files, folder, and site collections. Internal users can share with external collaborators, who with the right permissions, could share those to another external party.

## Remediation

### From Console

To set SharePoint sharing settings, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Under `Admin centers` select `SharePoint`.
2. Expand `Policies` then select `Sharing`.
3. Expand `More external sharing settings`, uncheck `Allow guests to share items they don't own`.
4. Click `Save`.

To Set Prevent external users from sharing files, folders, and sites that they donâ€™t own, use the SharePoint Online PowerShell Module:

1. Connect to SharePoint Online service using `Connect-SPOService`.
2. Run the following SharePoint Online PowerShell command:

```
Set-SPOTenant -PreventExternalUsersFromResharing $True
```
