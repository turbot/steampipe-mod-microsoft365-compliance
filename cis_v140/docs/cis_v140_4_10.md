## Description

Publish Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) records for each Exchange Online Accepted Domain.

## Remediation

### From Console

To add DMARC records, use the following steps:

1. For each Exchange Online Accepted Domain, add the following record to DNS:

```bash
  Record:  _dmarc.domain1.com
  Type:  TXT
  Value:  v=DMARC1; p=none;
```

2. This will create a basic DMARC policy that audits compliance
