## Description

Enabling Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies allows Exchange Online and SharePoint Online content to be scanned for specific types of data like social security numbers, credit card numbers, or passwords.

Enabling DLP policies alerts users and administrators that specific types of data should not be exposed, helping to protect the data from accidental exposure.

## Remediation

To enable DLP policies, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Under `Admin centers` Select `Compliance` to open `Microsoft 365 compliance center`.
2. Under `Solutions` Select `Data loss prevention` then `Policies`.
3. Click `Create policy`.
