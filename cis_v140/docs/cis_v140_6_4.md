## Description

You should restrict storage providers that are integrated with Outlook on the Web.

By default additional storage providers are allowed in Outlook on the Web (such as Box, Dropbox, Facebook, Google Drive, OneDrive Personal, etc.). This could lead to information leakage and additional risk of infection from organizational non-trusted storage providers. Restricting this will inherently reduce risk as it will narrow opportunities for infection and data leakage.

## Remediation

To disable external storage providers, use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module:

1. Connect to Exchange Online using `Connect-ExchangeOnline`.
2. Run the following Powershell command:

```bash
Set-OwaMailboxPolicy -Identity OwaMailboxPolicy-Default -AdditionalStorageProvidersAvailable $false
```

3. Run the following Powershell command to verify that the value is now `False`:

```bash
Get-OwaMailboxPolicy | Format-Table Name, AdditionalStorageProvidersAvailable
```

**Default Value:** Additional Storage Providers - True
