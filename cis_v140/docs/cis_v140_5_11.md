## Description

You should review non-global administrator role group assignments at least every week.

While these roles are less powerful than a global admin, they do grant special privileges that can be used illicitly. If you see something unusual, contact the user to confirm it is a legitimate need.

## Remediation

To review non-global administrator role group assignments, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Go to `Security`.
2. Click on `Audit` then select `Search`.
3. Set `Added member to Role` and `Removed a user from a directory role` for Activities.
4. Set `Start Date` and `End Date`.
5. Click `Search`.
6. Review.
