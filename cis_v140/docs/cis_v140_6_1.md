## Description

You should control sharing of documents to external domains by either blocking domains or only allowing sharing with specific named domains.

Attackers will often attempt to expose sensitive information to external entities through sharing, and restricting the domains that your users can share documents with will reduce that surface area.

## Remediation

To configure document sharing restrictions, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Navigate to Microsoft 365 administration portal (https://admin.microsoft.com), Click on `Admin Centers` and then `SharePoint`.
2. Expand `Policies` then click `Sharing`.
3. Expand `More external sharing settings` and check `Limit external sharing by domain`.
4. Select `Add domains` to add a list of approved domains.
5. Click `Save` at the bottom of the page.

To configure document sharing restrictions, you can also use SharePoint Online PowerShell:

1. Connect to SharePoint Online using `Connect-SPOService`.
2. Run the following PowerShell command:

```bash
Set-SPOTenant -SharingDomainRestrictionMode AllowList -SharingAllowedDomainList "domain1.com domain2.com"
```

**Default Value:** Off.
