## Description

You should set your Exchange Online mail transport rules so they do not whitelist any specific domains.

## Remediation

### From Console

To alter the mail transport rules so they do not whitelist any specific domains, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Select `Exchange`.
2. Select `Mail Flow` and `Rules`.
3. For each rule that whitelists specific domains, select the rule and click the 'Delete' icon.

To remove mail transport rules you may also use the Exchange Online PowerShell:

1. Connect to Exchange online using `Connect-ExchangeOnline`.
2. Run the following PowerShell command:

```
  Remove-TransportRule {RuleName}
```
3. Verify the rules no longer exists.

```
  Get-TransportRule | Where-Object {($_.setscl -eq -1 -and $_.SenderDomainIs - ne $null)} | ft Name,SenderDomainIs
```
