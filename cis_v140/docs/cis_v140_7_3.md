## Description

Ensure that users passwords on their mobile devices, never expire.

While this is not the most intuitive recommendation, research has found that when periodic password resets are enforced, passwords become weaker as users tend to pick something weaker and then use a pattern of it for rotation. If a user creates a strong password: long, complex and without any pragmatic words present, it should remain just as strong is 60 days as it is today. It is Microsoft's official security position to not expire passwords periodically without a specific reason.

## Remediation

To set mobile device management profiles, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Select `Device Management` under `Admin Centers`.
2. Select `Devices`, then under `Policy` select `Configuration profiles`.
3. Review the list of profiles.
4. From there, go to the device policies page to remove any device security policies that expire passwords.

**Default Value:** Password changes are not required by default.
