Users should be able to send collaboration invitations to allowed domains only.

## Remediation

### From Console

From the Azure portal:

1. Go to Azure Active Directory
2. Go to `Users`.
3. Go to `User settings`.
4. Under `External users`, click on `Manage external collaboration settings`.
5. Under `Collaboration restrictions`, select `Allow invitations only to the specified domains (most restrictive)`, check the `Target domains` setting, and specify the domains allowed to collaborate.

**Default Value:** Allow invitations to be sent to any domain (most inclusive) and thus no domain is specified.
