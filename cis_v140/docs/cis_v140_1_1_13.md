## Description

Users should be able to send collaboration invitations to allowed domains only.

By specifying allowed domains for collaborations, external users companies are explicitly identified. Also, this prevents internal users from inviting unknown external users such as personal accounts and give them access to resources.

## Remediation

### From the Azure portal:

1. Go to Azure Active Directory
2. Go to `Users`.
3. Go to `User settings`.
4. Under `External users`, click on `Manage external collaboration settings`.
5. Under `Collaboration restrictions`, select `Allow invitations only to the specified domains (most restrictive)`, check the `Target domains` setting, and specify the domains allowed to collaborate.

**Default Value:** Allow invitations to be sent to any domain (most inclusive) and thus no domain is specified.
