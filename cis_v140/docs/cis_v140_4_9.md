## Description

For each domain that is configured in Exchange, a corresponding Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record should be created.

## Remediation

### From Console

To setup SPF records for Exchange Online accepted domains, perform the following steps:

1. If all email in your domain is sent from and received by Exchange Online, add the following TXT record for each Accepted Domain:

```bash
  v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all
```

2. If there are other systems that send email in the environment, refer to this article for the proper SPF configuration: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en- us/office365/SecurityCompliance/set-up-spf-in-office-365-to-help-prevent- spoofing](url).
