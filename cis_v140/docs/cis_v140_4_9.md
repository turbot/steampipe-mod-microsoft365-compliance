## Description

For each domain that is configured in Exchange, a corresponding Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record should be created.

By enabling DKIM with Office 365, messages that are sent from Exchange Online will be cryptographically signed. This will allow the receiving email system to validate that the messages were generated by a server that the organization authorized and not being spoofed.

## Remediation

To setup SPF records for Exchange Online accepted domains, perform the following steps:

1. If all email in your domain is sent from and received by Exchange Online, add the following TXT record for each Accepted Domain:

```bash
v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all
```

2. If there are other systems that send email in the environment, refer to this article for the proper SPF configuration: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/SecurityCompliance/set-up-spf-in-office-365-to-help-prevent-spoofing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/SecurityCompliance/set-up-spf-in-office-365-to-help-prevent-spoofing).
