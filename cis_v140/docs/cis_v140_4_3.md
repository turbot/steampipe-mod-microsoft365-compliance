## Description

You should set your Exchange Online mail transport rules to not forward email to domains outside of your organization. Automatic forwarding to prevent users from auto-forwarding mail via Outlook or Outlook on the web should also be disabled. Alongside this Client Rules Forwarding Block, which prevents the use of any client-side rules that forward email to an external domain, should also be enabled.

## Remediation

### From Console

***NOTE:*** Remediation is a three step procedure as follows:

***STEP 1:***

To alter the mail transport rules so they do not forward email to external domains, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Select `Exchange`.
2. Select `Mail Flow` and `Rules`.
3. For each rule that forwards email to external domains, select the rule and click the 'Delete' icon.

To perform remediation you may also use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module:

1. Connect to Exchange Online user `Connect-ExchangeOnline`.
2. Run the following Powershell command:

```bash
  Remove-TransportRule {RuleName} 
```
3. To verify this worked you may re-run the audit command as follows:

```bash
 Get-TransportRule | Where-Object {$_.RedirectMessageTo -ne $null} | ft Name,RedirectMessageTo
```
***STEP 2:***

To perform remediation you may use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module:

1. Connect to Exchange online using `Connect-ExchangeOnline`.
2. Run the following Powershell to disable auto-forwarding to remote domains:

```bash
  Set-RemoteDomain Default -AutoForwardEnabled $false
```
3. Run the following Powershell to verify `AutoForwardEnabled` is now set to `False`.

```bash
  Get-RemoteDomain Default | fl AllowedOOFType, AutoForwardEnabled
```
***STEP 3:***

To create the Client Rules Forwarding Block, use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module:

1. Connect to Exchange Online using `Connect-ExchangeOnline`.
2. Run the following Exchange Online PowerShell commands to create a rule:

```bash
$rejectMessageText = "To improve security, auto-forwarding rules to external
addresses have been disabled. Please contact your Microsoft Partner if you'd
like to set up an exception."

New-TransportRule -name "Client Rules To External Block" -Priority 0 - 
SentToScope NotInOrganization -FromScope InOrganization -MessageTypeMatches 
AutoForward -RejectMessageEnhancedStatusCode 5.7.1 -RejectMessageReasonText 
$rejectMessageText
```

- Note that `Client Rules To External Block` is a placeholder name, this may be named based on preference.

3. Verify that `Client Rules To External Block` or other named preference rule is created.
