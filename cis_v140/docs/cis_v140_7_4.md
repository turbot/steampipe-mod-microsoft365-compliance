## Description

You should not allow your users to use to connect with mobile devices that have been jail broken or rooted.

These devices have had basic protections disabled to run software that is often malicious and could very easily lead to an account or data breach.

## Remediation

To set mobile device management policies, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Under `Admin Centers` select `Endpoint Management`.
2. Select `Devices` and then under `Policy` select `Configuration profiles`.
3. Select `Create Policy`.
4. Set a `Name` for the policy, choose the appropriate `Platform`.
5. Under `Settings` and `Device Health` ensure that `Jailbroken devices` or `Rooted devices` is set to `Block`.
