## Description

Modern authentication in Microsoft 365 enables authentication features like multifactor authentication (MFA) using smart cards, certificate-based authentication (CBA), and third- party SAML identity providers.

Strong authentication controls, such as the use of multifactor authentication, may be circumvented if basic authentication is used by SharePoint applications. Requiring modern authentication for SharePoint applications ensures strong authentication mechanisms are used when establishing sessions between these applications, SharePoint, and connecting users.

## Remediation

To set SharePoint settings, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Under `Admin centers` select `SharePoint`.
2. Expand the `Policies` section then select `Access control`.
3. Select `Apps that don't use modern authentication`.
4. Select the radio button for `Block access`.
5. Click `Save`.

To set Apps that don't use modern authentication is set to Block, use the SharePoint Online PowerShell Module:

1. Connect to SharePoint Online using `Connect-SPOService -Url https://tenant- admin.sharepoint.com `replacing tenant with your value.
2. Run the following Sharepoint Online PowerShell command:

```bash
Set-SPOTenant -LegacyAuthProtocolsEnabled $false
```
