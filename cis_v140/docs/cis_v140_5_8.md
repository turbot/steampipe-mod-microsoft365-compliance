## Description

You should review the Mailbox Access by Non-Owners report at least every other week. This report shows which mailboxes have been accessed by someone other than the mailbox owner.

While there are many legitimate uses of delegate permissions, regularly reviewing that access can help prevent an external attacker from maintaining access for a long time, and can help discover malicious insider activity sooner.

**NOTE:** This setting is only available in the classic Exchange Admin center.

## Remediation

To review the report, perform the following steps using the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Click `Exchange`.
2. Click on `Classic Exchange admin center`.
3. Click `Compliance Management and auditing`.
4. Select `Run a non-owner mailbox access report`.
5. Enter `Start Date` and `End Date`.
6. Change `Search for access by` field to `all non-owners`.
7. Select `Search`.
