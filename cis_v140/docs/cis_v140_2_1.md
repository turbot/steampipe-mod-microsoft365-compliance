## Description

Do not allow third party integrated applications to connect to your services.

You should not allow third party integrated applications to connect to your services unless there is a very clear value and you have robust security controls in place. While there are legitimate uses, attackers can grant access from breached accounts to third party applications to exfiltrate data from your tenancy without having to maintain the breached account.

## Remediation

To prohibit third party integrated applications, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Select `Admin Centers` and `Azure Active Directory`.
2. Select `Users` from the Azure navigation pane.
3. Select `Users settings`.
4. Set `App registrations` is set to `No`.
5. Click `Save`.

**Default Value:** Yes
