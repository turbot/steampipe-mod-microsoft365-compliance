## Description

Enable Azure Active Directory Password Protection to Active Directory to protect against the use of common passwords.

Azure Active Directory protects an organization by prohibiting the use of weak or leaked passwords. In addition, organizations can create custom banned password lists to prevent their users from using easily guessed passwords that are specific to their industry. Deploying this feature to Active Directory will strengthen the passwords that are used in the environment.
