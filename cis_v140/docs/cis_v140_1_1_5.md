## Description

Enable Azure Active Directory Password Protection to Active Directory to protect against the use of common passwords.

The potential impact associated with implementation of this setting is dependent upon the existing password policies in place in the environment. For environments that have strong password policies in place, the impact will be minimal. For organizations that do not have strong password policies in place, implementation of Azure Active Directory Password Protection may require users to change passwords, and adhere to more stringent requirements than they have been accustomed to.
