## Description

Enabling self-service password reset allows users to reset their own passwords in Azure AD. When your users sign in to Microsoft 365, they will be prompted to enter additional contact information that will help them reset their password in the future. If combined registration is enabled additional information, outside of multi-factor, will not be needed. As of August 2020 combined registration is enabled by default.
