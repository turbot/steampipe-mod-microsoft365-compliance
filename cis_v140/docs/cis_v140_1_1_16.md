## Description

The option for the user to Stay signed in or the Keep me signed in option will prompt a user after a successful login, when the user selects this option a persistent refresh token is created. Typically this lasts for 90 days and does not prompt for sign-in or Multi-Factor.

## Remediation

### From Console

To verify the option to remain signed in is disabled, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Log in to `https://admin.microsoft.com` as a `Global Administrator`.
2. Go to `Admin centers` and click on `Azure Active Directory`, once in the AD Admin Center select `Azure Active Directory`.
3. Scroll down and select `Company branding` under `Manage` followed by the appropriate policy.
   - If no policy exists you will need to create one.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the newly opened pane and ensure `Show option to remain signed in` is set to `No`.
5. Click `Save`.
