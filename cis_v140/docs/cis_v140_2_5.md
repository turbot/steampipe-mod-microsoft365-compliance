## Description

By default SharePoint online allows files that Defender for Office 365 has detected as infected to be downloaded.

Defender for Office 365 for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams protects your organization from inadvertently sharing malicious files. When an infected file is detected, that file is blocked so that no one can open, copy, move, or share it until further actions are taken by the organization's security team.

## Remediation

To set O365 SharePoint to disallow download of infected files, use Powershell:

1. Connect using `Connect-SPOService`, you will need to enter the URL for your Sharepoint Online admin page `https://*-admin.sharepoint.com` as well as a Global Admin account.
2. Run the following Powershell command to set the value to `True`.

```bash
Set-SPOTenant â€“DisallowInfectedFileDownload $true
```

3. After several minutes run the following to verify the value for `DisallowInfectedFileDownload` has been set to `True`.

```bash
Get-SPOTenant | Select-Object DisallowInfectedFileDownload
```
