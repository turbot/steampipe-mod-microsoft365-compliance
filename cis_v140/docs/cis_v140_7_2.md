## Description

You should not allow your users to reuse the same password on their mobile devices.

Devices without this protection are vulnerable to being accessed by attackers who can then steal account credentials, data, or install malware on the device. Choosing unique and unused passwords every time a password changes on mobile devices lessens the likelihood that the password can be guessed by an attacker.

## Remediation

To set mobile device management profiles, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Under `Admin Centers` select `Endpoint Management`.
2. Select `Devices` and then under `Policy` select `Configuration profiles`.
3. Select `Create profile`.
4. Set a `Name` for the policy, choose the appropriate `Platform` and select `Device restrictions`.
5. In the `Password` section, ensure that `Prevent reuse of previous passwords` is set to `5`.

**Default Value:** Password reuse is not enforced by default.
