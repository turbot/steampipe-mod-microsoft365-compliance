## Description

You should configure your mobile device management policies to require advanced security configurations. If you do not require this, users will be able to connect from devices that are vulnerable to basic internet attacks, leading to potential breaches of accounts and data.

## Remediation

### From Console

To set mobile device management profiles, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Under `Admin Centers` select `Endpoint Management`.
2. Select `Devices` and then under `Policy` select `Configuration profiles`
3. Select `Create profile` to create a new profile. Select the appropriate Platform and settings from the configuration screens.
