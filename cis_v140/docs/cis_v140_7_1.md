## Description

You should configure your mobile device management policies to require advanced security configurations. If you do not require this, users will be able to connect from devices that are vulnerable to basic internet attacks, leading to potential breaches of accounts and data.

Managing mobile devices in your organization, helps provide a basic level of security to protect against attacks from these platforms. For example ensure that the device is up to date on patches or is not rooted. These configurations open those devices to vulnerabilities that are addressed in patched versions of the mobile OS.

## Remediation

To set mobile device management profiles, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Under `Admin Centers` select `Endpoint Management`.
2. Select `Devices` and then under `Policy` select `Configuration profiles`.
3. Select `Create profile` to create a new profile. Select the appropriate Platform and settings from the configuration screens.
