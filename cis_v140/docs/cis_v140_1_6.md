## Description

Administrative accounts are special privileged accounts that could have varying levels of access to data, users, and settings. Regular user accounts should never be utilized for Administrative tasks and care should be taken, in the case of a hybrid environment, to keep Administrative accounts separated from on-prem accounts. Administrative accounts should not have applications assigned so that they have no access to potentially vulnerable services (EX. email, Teams, Sharepoint, etc.) and only access to perform tasks as needed for Administrative purposes.

## Remediation:

### From Console

To created non-licensed Administrative accounts for Administrative users, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:
1. Log in to `https://admin.microsoft.com` as a `Global Administrator`.
2. Go to `Admin centers` and click on `Azure Active Directory`.
3. Select `Users` > `Active` users then click `Add a user`.
4. Fill out the appropriate fields for Name, user, etc.
5. When prompted to assign licenses select `Create user without product license (not recommended)`, then click `Next`.
6. Under the `Option settings` screen you may choose from several types of Administrative access roles. Choose `Admin center access` followed by the appropriate role then click `Next`.
7. Select `Finish adding`.
