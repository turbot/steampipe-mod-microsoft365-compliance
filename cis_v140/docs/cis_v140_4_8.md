## Description

You should use DKIM in addition to SPF and DMARC to help prevent spoofers from sending messages that look like they are coming from your domain.

## Remediation

### From Console

To setup DKIM records, first add the following records to your DNS system, for each domain in Exchange Online that you plan to use to send email with:

1. For each accepted domain in Exchange Online, two DNS entries are required.

```bash
Host name: selector1._domainkey
Points to address or value: selector1-<domainGUID>._domainkey.<initialDomain>
TTL: 3600
Host name: selector2._domainkey
Points to address or value: selector2-<domainGUID>._domainkey.<initialDomain>
TTL: 3600
```

For Office 365, the selectors will always be `selector1` or `selector2`. domainGUID is the same as the domainGUID in the customized MX record for your custom domain that appears before mail.protection.outlook.com. For example, in the following MX record for the domain contoso.com, the domainGUID is contoso-com:

```bash
contoso.com. 3600 IN MX 5 contoso-com.mail.protection.outlook.com
```

The initial domain is the domain that you used when you signed up for Office 365. Initial domains always end in on microsoft.com.

1. After the DNS records are created, enable DKIM signing in the Office 365 Admin Portal.
2. Launch the `Security` Admin Center.
3. Under `Email & collaboration` navigate to `Policies & rules` > `Threat policies`.
4. Under `Rules` click `DKIM`.
5. Click on each domain and click `Enable` next to `Sign messages for this domain with DKIM signature`.

To set DKIM is enabled, use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module:

1. Connect to Exchange Online service using `Connect-ExchangeOnline`.
2. Run the following Exchange Online PowerShell command:

```bash
Set-DkimSigningConfig -Identity < domainName > -Enabled $True
```
