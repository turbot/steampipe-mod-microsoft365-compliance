## Description

Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps gives you insight into suspicious activity in Microsoft 365 so you can investigate situations that are potentially problematic and, if needed, take action to address security issues.

You can receive notifications of triggered alerts for atypical or suspicious activities, see how your organization's data in Microsoft 365 is accessed and used, suspend user accounts exhibiting suspicious activity, and require users to log back in to Microsoft 365 apps after an alert has been triggered.

## Remediation

To enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Select `Security`.
2. Select `More Resources`.
3. Select `Open` under `Microsoft Defender for Cloud App Security`.
4. Ensure the dashboard opens and the feature is enabled.
