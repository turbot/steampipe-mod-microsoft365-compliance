## Description

You should review the Malware Detections report at least weekly. This report shows specific instances of Microsoft blocking a malware attachment from reaching your users.

While this report isn't strictly actionable, reviewing it will give you a sense of the overall volume of malware being targeted at your users, which may prompt you to adopt more aggressive malware mitigations.

## Remediation

1. Select `Security`.
2. Click on `Reports` then select `Email & collaboration reports`.
3. Under `Threat protection status `click on `View details`.
4. Review the chart and look for `Email Malware` statistics`.
