## Description

You should configure your mobile device management policies to require the policy to manage the email profile of the user.

If you do not require this, users will be able to setup and configure email accounts without the protections of the mobile device management policy, leading to potential breaches of accounts and data.

## Remediation

To set mobile device management policies, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Select `Device Management` under `Admin Centers`.
2. Select `Device compliance` and then under `Policy` select `Compliance policies`.
3. Select `Create Policy`.
4. Set a `Name` for the policy, choose the appropriate `Platform`.
5. Under `Settings` and `Email` ensure that `Require mobile devices to have a managed email profile` is set to `Require`.

**Default Value:** This setting is not enabled by default.
