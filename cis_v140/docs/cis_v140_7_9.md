## Description

You should require your users to use a complex password with a at least two character sets (letters and numbers, for example) to unlock their mobile devices.

Devices without this protection are vulnerable to being accessed physically by attackers who can then steal account credentials, data, or install malware on the device.

## Remediation

To set mobile device management profiles, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Under `Admin Centers` select `Endpoint Management`.
2. Select `Devices` and then under `Policy` select `Configuration profiles`.
3. Select `Create profile`.
4. Set a `Name` for the policy, choose the appropriate `Platform` and select `Device restrictions`.
5. In the `Password` section, ensure that `Required password type` is set to `Alphanumeric`.

**Default Value:** This setting is not enabled by default.
