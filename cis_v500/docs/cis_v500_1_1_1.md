## Description

Administrative accounts are special privileged accounts that could have varying levels of access to data, users, and settings. Regular user accounts should never be utilized for administrative tasks and care should be taken, in the case of a hybrid environment, to keep administrative accounts separate from on-prem accounts. Administrative accounts should not have applications assigned so that they have no access to potentially vulnerable services (EX. email, Teams, SharePoint, etc.) and only access to perform tasks as needed for administrative purposes.

Ensure administrative accounts are not On-premises sync enabled.

## Remediation

Remediation will require first identifying the privileged accounts that are synced from onpremises and then creating a new cloud-only account for that user. Once a replacement account is established, the hybrid account should have its role reduced to that of a nonprivileged user or removed depending on the need.
