## Description

Access reviews enable administrators to establish an efficient automated process for reviewing group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. These reviews can be scheduled to recur regularly, with flexible options for delegating the task of reviewing membership to different members of the organization.

Ensure `Access reviews` for high privileged Entra ID roles are done monthly or more frequently. These reviews should include at a minimum the roles listed below:

- Global Administrator
- Exchange Administrator
- SharePoint Administrator
- Teams Administrator
- Security Administrator

**Note:** An access review is created for each role selected after completing the process.
