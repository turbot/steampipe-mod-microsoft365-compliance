Remediation steps will depend on the status of the personnel in question or configuration of Conditional Access policies and will not be covered in detail. Administrators should review each user identified on a case-by-case basis using the conditions below.

**User has never signed on:**

- Employment status should be reviewed, and appropriate action taken on the user account's roles, licensing and enablement.

**Conditional Access policy applicability:**

- Ensure a CA policy is in place requiring all users to use MFA.
- Ensure the user is not excluded from the CA MFA policy.
- Ensure the policy's state is set to `On`.
- Use `What if` to determine applicable CA policies. (Protection > Conditional Access > Policies)
- Review the user account in Sign-in logs. Under the `Activity Details` pane click the `Conditional Access` tab to view applied policies.`

**Note:** Conditional Access is covered step by step in section 5.2.2
