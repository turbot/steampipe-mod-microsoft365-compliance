## Description

Access reviews enable administrators to establish an efficient automated process for reviewing group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. These reviews can be scheduled to recur regularly, with flexible options for delegating the task of reviewing membership to different members of the organization.

Guest user access reviews are particularly important because:
- **Guest users are external to the organization** and may no longer need access
- **Business relationships change** and guest access may become unnecessary
- **Temporary projects end** but guest accounts often remain active
- **Security risks increase** with stale external accounts
- **Compliance requirements** often mandate periodic review of external access

Without regular access reviews, guest accounts accumulate and create security risks:
- Unnecessary access to sensitive data
- Accounts belonging to former business partners
- Inactive accounts that could be compromised
- Compliance violations for data privacy regulations
- Lack of visibility into who has external access

Access reviews for guest users help organizations:
- Maintain least privilege access
- Remove access for users who no longer need it
- Meet compliance requirements for periodic access certification
- Detect anomalous or inappropriate access
- Maintain accurate records of external access

**Note:** This feature requires Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft 365 E5 license.

**To remediate using PowerShell:**

Access reviews can be created using Microsoft Graph PowerShell:

```bash
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "AccessReview.ReadWrite.All"

$params = @{
    DisplayName = "Quarterly Guest User Access Review"
    DescriptionForAdmins = "Review of all guest user access to Microsoft 365 groups"
    DescriptionForReviewers = "Please review whether guest users still require access"
    Scope = @{
        Query = "/groups?$filter=(groupTypes/any(c:c+eq+'Unified'))&$select=id,displayName"
        QueryType = "MicrosoftGraph"
    }
    InstanceEnumerationScope = @{
        Query = "/users?$filter=userType eq 'Guest'"
        QueryType = "MicrosoftGraph"
    }
    Reviewers = @(
        @{
            Query = "./members/microsoft.graph.user"
            QueryType = "MicrosoftGraph"
            QueryRoot = "decisions"
        }
    )
    Settings = @{
        RecurrenceSettings = @{
            Pattern = @{
                Type = "absoluteMonthly"
                Interval = 3
            }
            Range = @{
                Type = "noEnd"
            }
        }
        DefaultDecisionEnabled = $true
        DefaultDecision = "Deny"
        AutoApplyDecisionsEnabled = $true
        RecommendationsEnabled = $true
    }
}

New-MgIdentityGovernanceAccessReviewDefinition -BodyParameter $params
```

### Default Value

No access reviews are configured by default. Guest users are not automatically reviewed.
