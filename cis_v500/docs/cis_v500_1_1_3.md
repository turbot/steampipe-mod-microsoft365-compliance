## Description

Between two and four global administrators should be designated in the tenant. Ideally, these accounts will not have licenses assigned to them which supports additional controls found in this benchmark.

If there is only one global administrator, they could perform malicious activities without being detected by another admin. Designating multiple global administrators eliminates this risk and ensures redundancy if the sole remaining global administrator leaves the organization.

However, to minimize the attack surface, there should be no more than four global admins set for any tenant. A large number of global admins increases the likelihood of a successful account breach by an external attacker.
