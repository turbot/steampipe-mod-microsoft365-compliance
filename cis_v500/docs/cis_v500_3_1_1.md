## Description

When audit log search is enabled in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, user and admin activity within the organization is recorded in the audit log and retained for 180 days by default. However, some organizations may prefer to use a third-party security information and event management (SIEM) application to access their auditing data. In this scenario, a global admin can choose to turn off audit log search in Microsoft 365.

## Remediation

1. Navigate to `Microsoft Purview` [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com).
2. Select `Solutions` and then `Audit` to open the audit search.
3. Click blue bar `Start recording user and admin activity.`
4. Click `Yes` on the dialog box to confirm.

**To remediate using PowerShell:**

2. Run the following PowerShell command:

```
