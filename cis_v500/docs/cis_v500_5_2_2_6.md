## Description

Microsoft Entra ID Protection user risk policies detect the probability that a user account has been compromised.

**Note:** While Identity Protection also provides two risk policies with limited conditions, Microsoft highly recommends setting up risk-based policies in Conditional Access as opposed to the "legacy method" for the following benefits:

- Enhanced diagnostic data
- Report-only mode integration
- Graph API support
- Use more Conditional Access attributes like sign-in frequency in the policy

## Remediation

**To remediate using the UI:**

1. Navigate to `Microsoft Entra admin center` [https://entra.microsoft.com/](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
2. Click to expand `Protection` > `Conditional Access` select `Policies`.
3. Create a new policy by selecting `New policy`.
4. Set the following conditions within the policy:
   - Under `Users` choose `All users`.
   - Under `Target resources` choose `All resources (formerly 'All cloud apps')`.
   - Under `Conditions` choose `User risk` then `Yes` and select the user risk level `High`.
   - Under `Grant` select `Grant access` then check `Require multifactor authentication` or `Require authentication strength`. Finally check `Require password change.`
   - Under `Session` set `Sign-in frequency` to `Every time.`
   - Click `Select`.
5. Under `Enable policy` set it to `Report-only` until the organization is ready to enable it.
6. Click `Create` or `Save`.

**Note:** Break-glass accounts should be excluded from all Conditional Access policies.
