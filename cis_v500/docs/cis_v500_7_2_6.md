## Description

Control sharing of documents to external domains by either blocking domains or only allowing sharing with specific named domains.

Attackers will often attempt to expose sensitive information to external entities through sharing, and restricting the domains that users can share documents with will reduce that surface area.

## Remediation

**To remediate using the UI:**

1. Navigate to `SharePoint admin center` [https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint).
2. Expand `Policies` then click `Sharing`.
3. Expand `More external sharing settings` and check `Limit external sharing by domain.`
4. Select `Add domains` to add a list of approved domains.
5. Click `Save` at the bottom of the page.

**To remediate using PowerShell:**

1. Connect to SharePoint Online using `Connect-SPOService.`
2. Run the following PowerShell command:

```bash
Set-SPOTenant -SharingDomainRestrictionMode AllowList -
SharingAllowedDomainList "domain1.com domain2.com"
```

### Default Value

Limit external sharing by domain is unchecked
SharingDomainRestrictionMode: None
SharingDomainRestrictionMode: <Undefined>
