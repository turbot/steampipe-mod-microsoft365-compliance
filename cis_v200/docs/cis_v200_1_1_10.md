## Description

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Password Protection provides a global and custom banned password list. A password change request fails if there's a match in these banned password list. To protect on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment, install and configure Azure AD Password Protection.

**Note:** This recommendation applies to Hybrid deployments only, and will have no impact unless working with on-premises Active Directory.

Azure Active Directory protects an organization by prohibiting the use of weak or leaked passwords. In addition, organizations can create custom banned password lists to prevent their users from using easily guessed passwords that are specific to their industry. Deploying this feature to Active Directory will strengthen the passwords that are used in the environment.
