## Description

Azure Active Directory Identity Protection sign-in risk detects risks in real-time and offline. A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might not have been performed by the legitimate owner of a user account.

Turning on the sign-in risk policy ensures that suspicious sign-ins are challenged for multi-factor authentication.

## Remediation

To configure a Sign-In risk policy, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to `Microsoft Entra admin center` https://entra.microsoft.com/.
2. Browse to `Azure Active Directory` > `Protect & secure` > `Conditional Access`.
3. Create a new policy by selecting `New policy`.
4. Set the following conditions within the policy.
- Under `Users or workload identities` choose `All users`.
- Under `Cloud apps or actions` choose `All cloud apps`.
- Under `Conditions` choose `Sign-in risk` then Yes in the right pane followed by the appropriate level.
- Under `Access Controls` select `Grant` then in the right pane click `Grant access` then select `Require muilti-factor authentication`.
5. Click `Select`
6. You may opt to begin in a state of `Report Only` as you step through implementation however, the policy will need to be set to `On` to be in effect.
7. Click `Create`.
