## Description

Enabling self-service password reset allows users to reset their own passwords in Azure AD. When users sign in to Microsoft 365, they will be prompted to enter additional contact information that will help them reset their password in the future. If combined registration is enabled additional information, outside of multi-factor, will not be needed.

**NOTE:** Effective Oct. 1st, 2022, Microsoft will begin to enable combined registration for all users in Azure AD tenants created before August 15th, 2020. Tenants created after this date are enabled with combined registration by default.

Users will no longer need to engage the helpdesk for password resets, and the password reset mechanism will automatically block common, easily guessable passwords.

## Remediation

To enable self-service password reset:

1. Navigate to `Microsoft Entra admin center` https://entra.microsoft.com/.
2. Click to expand `Azure Active Directory` > `Users` select `All users`.
3. Under Manage, select `Password reset`.
4. Set `Self service password reset enabled` to `All`.
