## Description

Azure Active Directory Identity Protection user risk policies detect the probability that a user account has been compromised.

With the user risk policy turned on, Azure AD detects the probability that a user account has been compromised. Administrators can configure a user risk conditional access policy to automatically respond to a specific user risk level.

## Remediation

To configure a User risk policy, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to `Microsoft Entra admin center` https://entra.microsoft.com/.
2. Click to expand `Azure Active Directory` > `Protect & secure` select `Conditional Access`.
3. On the Conditional Access page, create a new policy by selecting `New policy`.
4. Set the following conditions within the policy:
- Under `Users or workload identities` choose `All users`.
- Under `Cloud apps or actions` choose `All cloud apps`.
- Under `Conditions` choose `User risk` then `Yes` in the right pane followed by the appropriate level.
- Under `Access Controls` select `Grant` then in the right pane click `Grant access` then select `Require password change`.
5. Click `Select`.
6. You may opt to begin in a state of `Report Only` as you step through implementation however, the policy will need to be set to `On` to be in effect.
7. Click `Create`.
