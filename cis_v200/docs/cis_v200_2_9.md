## Description

By default, users can install add-ins in their Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint applications, allowing data access within the application.

Do not allow users to install add-ins in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.

Attackers commonly use vulnerable and custom-built add-ins to access data in user applications.

While allowing users to install add-ins by themselves does allow them to easily acquire useful add-ins that integrate with Microsoft applications, it can represent a risk if not used and monitored carefully.

Disable future user's ability to install add-ins in Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint helps reduce your threat-surface and mitigate this risk.

## Remediation
