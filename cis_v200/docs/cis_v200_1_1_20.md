## Description

Restrict non-privileged users from signing into the Azure Active Directory portal.

**NOTE:** This recommendation only affects access to the Azure AD web portal. It does not prevent privileged users from using other methods such as Rest API or PowerShell to obtain information. Those attack channels are addressed elsewhere in this document.

The Azure AD administrative (AAD) portal contains sensitive data and permission settings, which are still enforced based on the user's role. However, an end user may inadvertently change properties or account settings that could result in increased administrative overhead. Additionally, a compromised end user account could be used by a malicious attacker as a means to gather additional information and escalate an attack.

**NOTE:** Users will still be able to sign into `Azure Active directory admin center` but will be unable to see directory information.

## Remediation

Ensure access to the Azure AD portal is restricted:

1. Navigate to `Azure Active Directory admin center` https://aad.portal.azure.com/.
2. Select `Users` then `User settings`.
3. For the setting `Restrict access to Azure AD administration portal` click `Yes` then `Save`.

**Default Value:** No - Non-administrators can access the Azure AD administration portal.
