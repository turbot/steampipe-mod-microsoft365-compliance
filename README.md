## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [Microsoft 365 plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/microsoft365) and [Azuread plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/azuread) as the data source. Install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install microsoft365
steampipe plugin install azuread
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default Microsoft 365 credentials. Optionally, you can [setup multiple accounts](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/microsoft365#multi-account-connections) or [customize Microsoft 365 credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/microsoft365#configuring-microsoft365-credentials) or [customize Azure AD credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/microsoft365#configuring-microsoft365-credentials).

Finally, install the mod:

```sh
mkdir dashboards
cd dashboards
powerpipe mod init
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/powerpipe-mod-office365-compliance
```

### Browsing Dashboards

Start Steampipe as the data source:

```sh
steampipe service start
```

Start the dashboard server:

```sh
powerpipe server
```

Browse and view your dashboards at **http://localhost:9033**.

### Running Checks in Your Terminal

Instead of running benchmarks in a dashboard, you can also run them within your
terminal with the `powerpipe benchmark` command:

List available benchmarks:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark list
```

Run a benchmark:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run microsoft365_compliance.benchmark.cis_v300_1_1
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
[Output Formats](https://powerpipe.io/docs/reference/cli/benchmark#output-formats).

### Common and Tag Dimensions

The benchmark queries use common properties (like `compartment`, `compartment_id`, `connection_name`, `region`, `tenant` and `tenant_id`) and tags that are defined in the form of a default list of strings in the `variables.sp` file. These properties can be overwritten in several ways:

It's easiest to setup your vars file, starting with the sample:

```sh
cp powerpipe.ppvar.example powerpipe.ppvars
vi powerpipe.ppvars
```

Alternatively you can pass variables on the command line:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run microsoft365_compliance.benchmark.cis_v300_1_1 --var 'common_dimensions=["connection_name", "region", "tenant"]'
```

Or through environment variables:

```sh
export PP_VAR_common_dimensions='["connection_name", "region", "tenant"]'
export PP_VAR_tag_dimensions='["Department", "Environment"]'
powerpipe benchmark run microsoft365_compliance.benchmark.cis_v300_1_1
```
