## Description

Access reviews enable administrators to establish an efficient automated process for reviewing group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. These reviews can be scheduled to recur regularly, with flexible options for delegating the task of reviewing membership to different members of the organization.

Ensure `Access reviews` for Guest Users are configured to be performed no less frequently than `monthly`.
