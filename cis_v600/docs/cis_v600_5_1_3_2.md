## Description

This setting allows users in the organization to create new security groups and add members to these groups in the Azure portal, API, or PowerShell. These new groups also show up in the Access Panel for all other users. If the policy setting on the group allows it, other users can create requests to join these groups.

The recommended state is `Users can create security groups in Azure portals, API or PowerShell` set to `No`.
