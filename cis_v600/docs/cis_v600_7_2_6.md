## Description

The external sharing features of SharePoint and OneDrive let users in the organization share content with people outside the organization (such as partners, vendors, clients, or customers). It can also be used to share between licensed users on multiple Microsoft 365 subscriptions if your organization has more than one subscription.

The recommended state is `Limit external sharing by domain > Allow only specific domains.`
