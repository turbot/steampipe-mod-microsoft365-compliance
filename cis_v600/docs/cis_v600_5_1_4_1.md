## Description

This setting enables you to select the users who can register their devices as Microsoft Entra joined devices.

The recommended state is `Selected` or `None`.

**Note:** This setting is applicable only to Microsoft Entra join on Windows 10 or newer. This setting doesn't apply to Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, Microsoft Entra joined VMs in Azure, or Microsoft Entra joined devices that use Windows Autopilot selfdeployment mode because these methods work in a userless context.

2. Click to expand `Entra ID` > `Devices` select `Device settings`.
3. Set `Users may join devices to Microsoft Entra` to `Selected` (and add members) or `None`.
