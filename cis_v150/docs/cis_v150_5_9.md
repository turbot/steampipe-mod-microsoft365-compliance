## Description

The Account Provisioning Activity report details any account provisioning that was attempted by an external application.

If you don't usually use a third party provider to manage accounts, any entry on the list is likely illicit. If you do, this is a great way to monitor transaction volumes and look for new or unusual third party applications that are managing users. If you see something unusual, contact the provider to determine if the action is legitimate.

## Remediation

To review the report, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Go to `Security`.
2. Click on `Audit` then select `Search`.
3. Set `Activities` to `Added user` for `User administration activities`.
4. Set `Start Date` and `End Date`.
5. Click `Search`.
6. Review.

To review Account Provisioning Activity report, use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module:

1. Connect to Exchange Online service using `Connect-EXOPSSession`.
2. Run the following Exchange Online PowerShell command:

```bash
$startDate = ((Get-date).AddDays(-7)).ToShortDateString()
$endDate = (Get-date).ToShortDateString()

```
