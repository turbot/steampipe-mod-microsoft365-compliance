## Description

Azure Active Directory Identity Protection user risk policies detect the probability that a user account has been compromised.

With the user risk policy turned on, Azure AD detects the probability that a user account has been compromised. As an administrator, you can configure a user risk conditional access policy to automatically respond to a specific user risk level. For example, you can block access to your resources or require a password change to get a user account back into a clean state.

## Remediation

To configure a User risk policy, use the following steps:

1. Log in to `https://admin.microsoft.com` as a `Global Administrator`.
2. Go to `Admin centers` and click on `Azure Active Directory`.
3. Select `Azure Active Directory` then `Security`.
4. Select `Conditional Access`.
5. Create a new policy by selecting `New policy`.
6. Set the following conditions within the policy.
   - Under `Users or workload identities` choose `All users`.
   - Under `Cloud apps or actions` choose `All cloud apps`.
   - Under `Conditions` choose `User risk` then `Yes` in the right pane followed by the appropriate level.
   - Under `Access Controls` select `Grant` then in the right pane click `Grant access` then select `Require password change`.
7. Click `Select`.
8. You may opt to begin in a state of `Report Only` as you step through implementation however, the policy will need to be set to `On` to be in effect.
9. Click `Create`.
