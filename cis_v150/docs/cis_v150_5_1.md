## Description

When audit log search in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal is enabled, user and admin activity from your organization is recorded in the audit log and retained for 90 days. However, your organization might be using a third-party security information and event management (SIEM) application to access your auditing data. In that case, a global admin can turn off audit log search in Microsoft 365.

Enabling Microsoft Purview audit log search helps Office 365 back office teams to investigate activities for regular security operational or forensic purposes.
