## Description

Azure Active Directory Identity Protection sign-in risk detects risks in real-time and offline. A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might not have been performed by the legitimate owner of a user account.

Turning on the sign-in risk policy ensures that suspicious sign-ins are challenged for multi-factor authentication.

## Remediation

To configure a Sign-In risk policy, use the following steps:

1. Log in to `https://admin.microsoft.com` as a `Global Administrator`.
2. Go to `Admin centers` and click on `Azure Active Directory`.
3. Select `Azure Active Directory` then `Security`.
4. Select `Conditional Access`.
5. Create a new policy by selecting `New policy`.
6. Set the following conditions within the policy.
    - Under `Users or workload identities` choose `All users`.
    - Under `Cloud apps or actions` choose `All cloud apps`.
    - Under `Conditions` choose `Sign-in risk` then `Yes` in the right pane followed by the appropriate level.
    - Under `Access Controls` select `Grant` then in the right pane click `Grant access` then select `Require muilti-factor authentication`.
7. Click `Select`.
8. You may opt to begin in a state of `Report Only` as you step through implementation however, the policy will need to be set to `On` to be in effect.
9. Click `Create`.
