## Description

This report contains records of accounts that have had activity that could indicate they are compromised, such as accounts that have:
  - successfully signed in after multiple failures, which is an indication that the accounts have cracked passwords
  - signed in to your tenant from a client IP address that has been recognized by Microsoft as an anonymous proxy IP address (such as a TOR network)
  - successful sign-ins from users where two sign-ins appeared to originate from different regions and the time between sign-ins makes it impossible for the user to have traveled between those regions

Reviewing this report on a regular basis allows for identification and remediation of compromised accounts.
